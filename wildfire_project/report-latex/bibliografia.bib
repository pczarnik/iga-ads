    abstract = {In this paper we present a fast explicit solver for solution of non-stationary problems using L2 projections with isogeometric finite element method. The solver has been implemented within GALOIS framework. It enables parallel multi-core simulations of different time-dependent problems, in 1D, 2D, or 3D. We have prepared the solver framework in a way that enables direct implementation of the selected PDE and corresponding boundary conditions. In this paper we describe the installation, implementation of exemplary three PDEs, and execution of the simulations on multi-core Linux cluster nodes. We consider three case studies, including heat transfer, linear elasticity, as well as non-linear flow in heterogeneous media. The presented package generates output suitable for interfacing with Gnuplot and ParaView visualization software. The exemplary simulations show near perfect scalability on Gilbert shared-memory node with four Intel® Xeon® CPU E7-4860 processors, each possessing 10 physical cores (for a total of 40 cores).

This imposes some restrictions on time step size required to maintain stability.}
